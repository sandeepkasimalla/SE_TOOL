Doxygen will generate a document for given source code.

It will give html, xml files etc., which will consists of description about the source code.

I have vizualized the architecture of the source code by parsing the html file.

Run the parser.py file in terminal for vizualised architecture of the source code.

Here are two tasks one is running the doxygen and the second one is parsing the generated html file.

For combing the both tasks as one I have used the python server as third party for running doxygen in background.
